# EE4307-Control-System-Design-and-Simulation
Coursework for the EE4307 module at NUS

This was a very enjoyable lab-based module, covering a rather broad range of topics and techniques within control theory. 

The labs helped to reinforce the material covered during the lectures and it also went further to more advanced topics like Optimal Control and Adaptive Control. 

Knowledge of MATLAB, Simulink and Python is recommended. I had no experience with Simulink at first, but learning it was quite ok.
